# About 
Turl is a terminal user interface application for api development inspired by a
very well known app. The app uses sqlite to store request, collections,
workspaces, etc... For now the main goal is to let the users execute and manage
HTTP request quickly inside collections and workspaces. The application uses
sqlite for the database, tui-rs for the rendering, and curl for the http request
execution.
